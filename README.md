# MetalLive
Inspired by the computer graphics technique called [Raymarching](https://computergraphics.stackexchange.com/questions/161/what-is-ray-marching-is-sphere-tracing-the-same-thing), [ShaderToy](https://www.shadertoy.com/) and it's creator [Inigo Quilez](https://iquilezles.org/), I wanted to create a OSX application that could use to author new shaders. The goal was to have the same live and interactive development experience as shadertoy but using Apple's Metal Shading language instead of GLSL and a desktop application instead of a browser
